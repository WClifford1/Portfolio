                    <p>I have recently completed a Diploma of Information Technology from the web-development bootcamp at Coderacademy in Brisbane. During my study I have gained experience working with multiple languages, libraries and frameworks, practiced using the AGILE methodology throughout the whole software development life cycle and learned about the industry standards and expectations that are relevant to a junior developer. I am currently completing an internship as a junior developer at Sortal, during which I have been working on projects for both the back-end and front-end, predominantly using Typescript, Mongodb, Express, React, Node and Docker. My goal is to work as a junior developer in an environment where I am encouraged to perform well and which is conducive to me pursuing career progression. I am open to remote work and open to relocation.</p>
